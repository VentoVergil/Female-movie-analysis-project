7782,Lohengrin,Music,en,De Munt / La Monnaie-Opera Australia-Theatre du capitole,0,0,217,Released,2018,‘In reality this Lohengrin is an entirely new phenomenon for the modern consciousness!’ Richard Wagner himself understood the innovative character of his sixth piece of music theatre completed in 1848 the year of revolutions. Although it is reckoned among his ‘romantic operas’ his new vision of musical drama is already clearly heralded in this work. In his hands the mediaeval saga of the Knight of the Swan becomes a meditation on the true love that asks no questions. Alain Altinoglu our Music Director who has already conducted this work in Bayreuth guarantees the quality of the music while the director Olivier Py known at La Monnaie for his brilliant productions of Les Huguenots and Hamlet can be relied on not to downplay Wagner’s revolutionary political side. Wagner’s own opinion was that ‘one can only understand Lohengrin if one can liberate oneself from any modern-looking generalising form of representation so as to see the phenomena of real life’. A challenge to us all?,0

9355,Janácek: From the House of the Dead,Music-Drama,en,BelAir Classiques,0,0,97,Released,2018,Stage director Frank Castorf “might have been born to direct From the House of the Dead” (Opera Today). His gritty visually striking adaptation brings bold modern and postmodern touches to Janáček’s masterwork without ever overshadowing the intense forward momentum of the music conducted to dramatic perfection by Simone Young and sung by an all-star cast in Munich.  Janáček adapted Dostoevsky for this powerfully compelling opera set in a Siberian prison camp full of starkly contrasting moods and motifs unusual in its episodic structure. The last opera Janáček ever composed its third act was on his desk when he died in 1928; attempts by his students to “complete” his orchestration have largely fallen away over the decades in favor of the original version. Despite the grimness of the setting and the brutality of several characters the composer’s compassion shines through in tender moments movingly illustrating his motto for the work: “in every creature a spark of God.”,0
